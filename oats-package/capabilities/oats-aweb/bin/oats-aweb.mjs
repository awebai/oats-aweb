/**
 * oats-aweb — OATS messaging-provider hooks for aweb.
 *
 * Invoked by the OATS kernel at instance lifecycle events (hook contract):
 *   oats-aweb spawn    mint a team-scoped aweb identity for the instance
 *   oats-aweb retire   gracefully self-delete it (BEFORE the home dir is removed)
 *   oats-aweb roster   list the aweb team's members — the cross-machine directory
 *                     of live instances (alias = instance name) and humans
 *   oats-aweb setup    guided onboarding: check the aw CLI, initialize the team
 *                     scope's aweb workspace, create/join the team
 *
 * Env contract (set by the kernel):
 *   OATS_EVENT     spawn|retire
 *   OATS_INSTANCE  instance name (used as the aweb alias)
 *   OATS_HOME      instance home dir (cwd is also set to it)
 *   OATS_CONTEXT   resolution context dir (the soul's repo / agents root parent)
 *   OATS_WORKSPACE the agents root's parent — the team boundary
 *   OATS_SETTINGS  JSON of the provider's `settings:` block
 *   OATS_TEAM_NAME/OATS_TEAM_ID/OATS_TEAM_SCOPE  resolved config `team:` block (may be empty)
 *   OATS_META      JSON persisted from this hook's previous spawn output (retire only)
 *
 * Output (spawn, stdout JSON):
 *   { "meta": {...persisted to instance.json + OATS_META at retire},
 *     "brief": "one-line TASK.md briefing line", "warning": "non-fatal problem" }
 *
 * EXIT CODE IS THE CONTRACT for the spawn hook. This capability declares
 * `spawn` as required (oats.json), so a nonzero exit fails the spawn and rolls it
 * back. Messaging is the whole point of the capability: an instance whose
 * identity was never minted believes it can be woken by mail and cannot, which
 * is worse than not starting. So identity failures exit nonzero, while genuinely
 * advisory problems (the Claude channel plugin, a team-name mismatch) stay
 * warnings on exit 0.
 *
 * On a fatal path, ALWAYS emit any metadata gathered so far before exiting: the
 * kernel feeds it to the retire hook to compensate partial state, and an
 * identity joined moments before the failure must still be deletable.
