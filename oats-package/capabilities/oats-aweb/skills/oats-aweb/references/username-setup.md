# Username setup and deployment default

Requires the provider 1.23.0 composition (#70), selected LOCAL deployment D,
messaging soul S, explicit account username and root alias. Selected kernel must
supply deployment scope and public `teams --dir D --json` (`teamsApi: 2`), add,
default and readback. Verified public source is OATS 0.42 at `bb2ba8c9`; this is
not an earliest-release claim or installation proof. Native argument/membership
contract is exercised with aw 1.36.23. No live account or timed M3 claim follows.

| Act / context | Exact command in D | Writes / success / one next step | Error → remedy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Preview selected username/root and configuration | `oats aweb setup --soul S --username <u> --name <alias> [--label L] --plan --json` | Reads policy/version and any retained membership; no install, root creation, signup or team mutation. Returns predicted team, chosen label/root and conditional add/default argv. Prediction is not membership proof; add may implicitly set default. Next: authorized apply below. | `E_SETUP_POLICY` only for `local-teams-closed`; `E_SETUP_TEAM_CONFLICT` for an existing different/unmapped label. Reconcile policy/declaration before apply or select a different label. |
| Create or resume, with the same authorized inputs | `oats aweb setup --soul S --username <u> --name <alias> [--label L] --json` | Missing root runs native `aw init --new-account --username <u> --name <alias>`. Retained root is read, never signed up again. Exactly one LOCAL membership must match `default:<u>.aweb.ai` and explicit alias. Observed canonical ID drives mapping; exact mapping is reused. Public kernel add/default is followed by readback; default runs only if still needed. Success requires matching membership, mapping and default. Next: `/oats-onboarding` staffing and receive verification. | `E_SETUP_MEMBERSHIP` → wrong/missing/ambiguous account, alias or scope; root is retained and nothing mapped. Reconcile the selected root; do not delete/reinitialize it. |
| Resume after a configuration failure | Repeat the same apply command after fixing its named kernel/configuration error | Retains root and matching mapping; no second signup. Reads actual state, including default side effect of add. Success requires final readback, not a successful prior command alone. Next: onboarding's staffing stage. | `E_SETUP_KERNEL` or `E_SETUP_READBACK` → inspect returned steps/observed configuration. Missing observed data means readback unavailable, not no writes. Repair the selected kernel/deployment before retry; no automatic rollback or success inference. |

Without `--label`, the label uses the existing team-name normalization: lowercase,
dots/underscores become hyphens, and leading/trailing hyphens are removed. Only
the label is normalized; the native account username is never rewritten or
inferred from a soul. Explicit label is a lowercase kernel label. The root alias
is always explicit and follows the existing 1–64 character aweb rule.

Closed policy and known label conflicts refuse before native bootstrap or CLI
installation. Their two manual reconciliation commands are returned as argv:
`oats teams add L --team T --dir D` and `oats teams default L --dir D`.
These commands cannot bypass shared declarations or closed policy; its owner
must resolve that first. Setup never edits shared files, imports private kernel
code or silently overwrites a mapping. `E_SETUP_ARGUMENT`, `E_SETUP_DEPLOYMENT`,
`E_SETUP_ROOT`, `E_SETUP_QUERY` and `E_SETUP_CONFIGURATION` require repairing
inputs/context, not relabelling every failure as policy closure.

`E_SETUP_NATIVE` preserves safe exit context and withholds credential-bearing
output. A failed signup can leave partial state; no automatic retry or deletion
is performed. `E_SETUP_AW` requires the explicit operator installation procedure
in `/oats-aweb` §8; `--install-aw` is never acted on by a plan. `--label/--plan`
apply only to `--username`, not API-key, controller-team, invite-join or GLOBAL
setup. Configuration success does not establish a connected receiver or consent.
