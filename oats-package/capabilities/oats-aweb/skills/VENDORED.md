To update, check out the named upstream repository at the intended reviewed commit, update the constants in `scripts/sync-vendored-skills.mjs`, then run from this repository root:

```bash
node scripts/sync-vendored-skills.mjs --source /path/to/aweb
npm test
git diff -- capabilities/oats-aweb/skills
```

The sync command refuses a checkout whose `HEAD` differs from its pinned commit. Review the complete generated diff, upstream license, and triggering descriptions before changing the recorded version/ref. Runtime acquisition never fetches these resources.
