// A grant seat's grants, as the resident's custody knows them. Every mint from
// oats.aweb 1.25.0 carries a label unique to its seat, oats:<instance>:<seat>,
// where <seat> is random at spawn and kept in the identity meta: names are
// reused after a retire and repeat across deployments under one resident, so
// neither the name nor the path identifies a seat. The custody's grant list
// (`aw id grant list --json`: every grant the resident ever issued in the team,
// with label, status and expiry) is the source of truth for what this seat
// still holds. A grant minted before a crash, or left by a failed revoke, is
// found there and revoked at the next start or at retire. Labels of any other
// form, including the bare oats:<instance> of earlier releases, are never
// touched.
