// The retained seat's lock, `.aw-retained-seat.json` beside a retained identity's
// `identity.source` (awebai/oats-aweb#236). It says which seat holds the standing
// identity: spawn creates it, a take-over (`identity.takeOver: true`) replaces it, a
// spawn's success rewrites it, and retire and a spawn's rollback remove it. Every one
// of those changes goes through `swapSeatLock`, so none acts on a lock it did not
// inspect at the moment it acts.
//
// The protocol, in one statement: every read, replace and remove of the lock happens
// under the guard; no guard spans an aw call; every exit after an aw call states the
// lock's holder as read under the guard, or says it is unknown; every guarded step
// reports what it could not clean, and nothing runs after a step that left anything.
//
// The protocol as a table: one row per operation that touches the lock or its private
// names (all in bin/oats-aweb.mjs). Each makes one guarded step: a read
// (readSeatLockGuarded) or a change (swapSeatLock). What it does for each outcome of
// that step's read of the lock:
// - ours: the lock names this home (in a spawn, with this spawn's takenAt);
// - another: it names another seat; absent: there is none;
// - unknown: its bytes can't be read, or it can't be checked;
// - refused: a guard or a moved-aside lock of another change is beside it, refused
//   with its fix before anything is read (SeatLockRefusal);
// - leftovers: the step left files it could not clean (SeatLockLeftovers): nothing runs
//   after it, and the exit names each file with its fix.
// [tag] is the test that pins the cell: the one marked `protocol: <tag>` in
// test/retained-seat-lock-236.test.mjs; [227: …] and [228: …] are tests of
// test/retained-seat-lock-227.test.mjs and test/retained-seat-killed-spawn-228.test.mjs.
//
// Spawn's read (a read; decides a plain spawn or a take-over). Exit 1, nothing copied,
// on every outcome but "absent" and a take-over:
//   ours, another (home here): refused, unless identity.takeOver
//     [227: a lock whose holder home exists still refuses without takeOver]
//   another (home not here): refused naming it, unless identity.takeOver
//     [227: a lock whose holder home is not on this host refuses, …]

//   unknown: refused as a lock that can't be read, unless identity.takeOver

//   refused [spawn-read/refused]; leftovers [spawn-read/leftovers]
// Take, or take-over (a change: absent, or the very lock read, to this spawn's lock).

//   another: names it [take/another]; absent (a take-over): spawn again [take/absent]
//   unknown: put back untouched [take/unknown]

//   refused [take/refused]; no guard [take/no-guard]; leftovers, taken or not
//     [take/leftovers]
// Success rewrite (a change: this spawn's lock to one with the alias):

//   another, absent, unknown, refused: not briefed; the rollback runs [rewrite/another,
//     rewrite/absent, rewrite/unknown, rewrite/refused]

//   leftovers: as for the rewrite [last-read/leftovers]
// The rollback's reads (a read before the legacy home's reconnect, and one after it).

//
// Two private names beside the lock, both written only inside swapSeatLock:
// - `<lock>.guard`: created exclusively (O_CREAT|O_EXCL) for the change and removed
//   after it. One change runs at a time; another waits GUARD_WAIT_MS for it, then
//   refuses. The guarded section is a few file operations and no aw call.
// - `<lock>.held`: the lock, moved aside by rename(2) while it is inspected. The
//   change applies only to what was moved: the expected lock is then removed, or
//   replaced by a fresh exclusive create; any other lock is linked back.
//
// Why this is atomic on a POSIX filesystem: rename(2) moves the name in one step, so
// what is inspected is exactly the file (inode) that was at the lock's name at that
// instant, whatever a writer that ignores the guard does to the name afterwards. A
// writer that overwrites the lock in place before the move changes the moved file
// itself, which is what is compared. link(2) and an O_EXCL create fail with EEXIST
// rather than replace a lock that appeared meanwhile. Among oats.aweb's own changes,
// the exclusive guard serializes them, so the lock's name is never empty in a way
// that lets another spawn create a lock in between.
//
// Where those calls are not atomic (some network and FUSE filesystems: NFS before v3
// has no exclusive create, and a client's retried rename or link can report an
// error for a step that took effect), two changes can both take the guard, or one
// can see a failure for a step that happened. Nothing here detects that. A link that
// the filesystem refuses (no hard links) falls back to an exclusive create of the
// moved lock's bytes.
//
// Nothing here infers age, a pid or liveness. A guard or a moved lock that a killed
// change left behind is found by the next change: it is refused with its whole fix,
// never adopted and never removed automatically.
