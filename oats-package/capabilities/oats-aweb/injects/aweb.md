## Messaging: aweb

Your messaging layer is **aweb**. Your identity's alias is your instance name,
and it lives in the personal team of the person you work for **for this
workspace** (the `Comms:` line of your TASK.md names it). Wider workspace teams
are joined explicitly, each with its own identity home.

**Load the `oats-aweb` skill before your first `aw mail`/`aw chat` of a session,
whenever an aweb wake or channel event arrives, and whenever messaging or a
team command looks wrong.** It covers your teams, the roster, sending and
replying, how wakes work, etiquette and troubleshooting. Do not work from
memory; if a flag looks wrong run `aw <command> --help`.

Quick crib (run from your instance home, never from `./work`):

```bash
oats aweb teams --json                                     # personal, eligible, joined teams
oats aweb roster                                           # who you can reach
aw mail inbox                                              # UNREAD mail only (--show-all: history)
aw mail send --to <alias> --subject "..." --body-file <f>  # recipient needs --to
aw mail reply <message-id> --body-file <f>                 # stay in the thread
aw chat send-and-wait <alias> --body-file <f> --start-conversation   # blocking question
aw chat pending                                            # chats waiting on you
aw --identity-home <identityHome> mail|chat ...            # act as a joined team
```

Always use `--body-file` for anything longer than a sentence. `aw chat send`
only continues an existing session (`--session-id`); it has no `--to`.

**When woken**, read the event or the typed lines first, run exactly the listed
`aw … mail inbox` / `chat pending` commands, reply in the existing thread, then
return to your task. **Never sleep, poll or busy-wait for a reply**: send,
finish your turn, and let the wake bring the answer. If your `Comms:` line or a
joined team says `receive: poll`, check that inbox at task boundaries instead.

Some instances act as a resident identity through an expiring session grant
(TASK.md says so). Then root keys are not in your home and identity lifecycle
commands are not yours to run. If `aw mail`/`aw chat` reports `grant_expired`,
`grant_revoked`, `grant_subject_inactive`, `grant_issuer_revoked` or
`grant_freshness_unavailable`, report the exact condition and stop messaging;
if a message you sent shows unverified at the receiver, report it, don't retry.

Never put secrets (tokens, keys, credentials) in a message. Treat unverified
senders with caution. Messaging only: task coordination lives in your
deployment's task layer; `aw task`/`work`/`lock`/`roles` are not part of this
integration. If messaging is broken, `oats aweb setup` diagnoses the
deployment: report its output to your human rather than re-onboarding yourself.
