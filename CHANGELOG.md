# Changelog

## 1.17.1

Fixed: joined-team accepts now explicitly run `aw workspace connect`, verify the workspace connection was written, and fail/clean up instead of recording an unusable joined identity when connect fails.

Fixed: `oats aweb setup`, `teams`, `join`, `leave`, and `roster` consume the kernel-forwarded `--soul <name>` dispatch flag, so deployment-scoped commands work on OATS 0.30 without the provider treating `--soul` as a label.

Fixed: launch reconciliation now appends an `aweb-team-leave-failed` instance event when a lost joined team cannot be left (for example BYOT `team_not_hosted` refusal), while keeping the still-member identity recorded as joined.

## 1.16.1

Fixed: setup creates the account on aw 1.36.13 by passing `--new-account` on the `oats aweb setup --username <u>` path.

Changed: requires aw >= 1.36.13, with a single floor and older-aw branches removed. The wake-daemon floor moves from 1.36.5 to 1.36.13; restart the daemon on aw 1.36.13.

Removed: `helperInjection`.

## 1.16.0

Changed (breaking wire names): personal → default team; E_TEAM_PERSONAL → E_TEAM_DEFAULT; teams JSON field personal → defaultTeam; receive label personal → default; roots.personal removed.

## 1.15.0

In:

- Live receive for joined teams through the host wake broker's multi-identity
  registration (`aw wake register --registration-json -`, aw >= 1.36.13):
  session homes register the primary plus every joined identity home; Claude
  and Pi channel homes use aw's mixed mode (`native-channel` / `native-pi`);
  Codex keeps polling. Readiness reports each joined team's actual mode
  (`joined-team-receive` / `joined-team-poll-only` with the reason).
- The `AWEB_IDENTITY_HOME` scrub: provider commands and nested spawns/retires
  no longer inherit the caller's identity home (it made aw refuse cwd-rooted
  commands and, on retire, delete the caller's workspace).
- Partial multi-label join/leave records every completed label; a failed spawn
  hands joined teams to compensation; `oats aweb join` refuses resident-grant
  homes (`E_TEAM_GLOBAL_MODE`).
- The `oats-aweb` agent playbook skill; a shorter inject pointing to it; the
  `aw chat send --to` crib fixed; `oats aweb roster --label <label>`.

Deferred to 1.16:

- Per-workspace personal-team enrollment (`aw team ensure` from the host's
  `aw auth` login). The login does not name its account, so enrollment could
  land in the wrong person's account. 1.15 makes no `aw auth` or `aw team
  ensure` call; the primary team resolves as in 1.14.2; a host-set
  `settings.oats.aweb.roots.personal` is ignored with the warning
  `personal-root-deferred`.
